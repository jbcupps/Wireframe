# Spacetime Klein Bottle (SKB) Hypothesis

## Background
The SKB hypothesis proposes that fundamental particles can be modeled as
four-dimensional spacetime Klein bottles. Each particle is composed of three
sub‑SKBs representing quark-like components that merge into a stable SKB
structure.

Two core papers outline this idea:
1. **A Categorical Framework for Topological Features of Spacetime Klein Bottles
   in Particle Physics**
2. **4D Spacetime Klein Bottles as Fundamental Particle Models**

These papers describe how topological invariants, such as orientability,
Euler characteristic, and intersection forms, correspond to particle properties
like mass and charge.

## Relation to the Application
The 4D Manifold Explorer visualizes individual sub‑SKBs and their merged forms
using Plotly.js and Three.js. Twist parameters control how sub‑SKBs combine,
mirroring the theoretical mechanisms described in the research. The evolutionary
algorithm searches parameter space for configurations that satisfy the topological
conditions laid out in the SKB hypothesis.

Interactive visualizations let users explore how varying twists and loop factors
influence the resulting manifold, providing an engaging way to test the
hypothesis.
