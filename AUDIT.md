# Repository Audit

## Structural Findings
- Removed compiled Python artifacts and deleted empty `app/` modules.
- Standardized the visualization page name from `index.html` to `visualization.html`.
- Introduced a `src/` directory housing application code, pages and static assets.
- Updated Dockerfile and Procfile to reference the new module path `src.app:app`.

## Navigation Issues & Fixes
- Landing page now links to `/visualization` correctly.
- All templates reside under `src/pages` for a single source of truth.

## Formatting Errors Resolved
- Added `.gitignore` to avoid tracking `__pycache__` and editor folders.
- Removed stray compiled files from version control.

## Font & Contrast
- Styles remain based on values defined in `docs/styleguide.md`; no contrast issues introduced.

## CI Status
- No automated tests present. `python -m py_compile src/app.py` succeeded.

## How to Review
1. Review commit `20f90a9` for cleanup and page rename.
2. Review commit `ac89e71` for initial `src/` scaffolding.
3. Review commit `aacc865` and later for relocation of code and updated deployment paths.
