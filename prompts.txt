# Prompts History

1. "Please fix the ocilator page"
   - Issue: Missing oscillator.js file in static/js directory
   - Action: Created oscillator.js with visualization code using Plotly.js
   - Components: 3D plot, spiral plot, real/imaginary components with envelopes
   - Features: Interactive controls for gamma, t0, omega parameters and animation

2. "Please fix the animation on the oscillation page"
   - Issue: Animation not properly updating point positions on plots
   - Action: Rewrote updateAnimation function to correctly handle moving points
   - Changes: 
     - Added proper trace management for animation points
     - Preserved 3D camera position during updates
     - Fixed point positioning on all four plots
     - Improved animation performance with optimized updates

3. "Please create a documentation folder and add documentation detailing all of the reasons for this and the use of this application"
   - Action: Created comprehensive documentation structure
   - Files created:

     - Implementation details and code examples
     - Technical architecture and deployment
     - Performance optimization and testing
     - Future considerations and maintenance

4. "Please review the linked documents for the academic papers on this and within the documentation section add some of the details and a description of the linked documents"
   - Action: Enhanced academic references section in oscillator.md
   - Added detailed descriptions for each reference:
     - Core quantum mechanics texts (Griffiths, Cohen-Tannoudji, Shankar)
     - Wave packet dynamics references (Schiff, Merzbacher)
     - Visualization methods (Feynman, Zettili)
     - Implementation references (Press, Goldstein, Thijssen, Giordano)
   - Included key equations from primary sources
   - Connected references to specific implementation details 

5. "Please add a new page into the site under the 4D Manifold section that uses a GAN and diffusion type approach to identify the particles that are most likely to be topological maps. Randomize the twists, randomize the curves, and randomize the different dimensional changes of the topology using the diffusion randomization, and then use the for the GAN piece use proper matching to map them properly."
   - Action: Created comprehensive Topological Diffusion GAN implementation
   - Files created:
     - templates/topological_diffusion.html: Interactive UI for diffusion GAN visualization
     - static/js/topological_diffusion.js: JavaScript implementation of diffusion and GAN functionality
     - Updated app.py with new route
   - Features:
     - Diffusion model for generating diverse topological structures
     - GAN architecture for training on manifold samples
     - Randomization of twist complexity, curve properties, and dimensional changes
     - Proper matching algorithm to identify particles of interest
     - Interactive 3D visualizations of the diffusion process, GAN training, and resulting topological maps
     - Real-time calculation of topological invariants (Euler characteristic, Betti numbers, etc.)
     - Configurable parameters for diffusion strength, sampling methods, and matching thresholds 

6. "Review the context of the application and understand the application. Then add these additional web pages.

Below are detailed instructions to build an interactive visualization of the double-slit experiment for the 4D Manifold Explorer, showcasing wave-particle duality and interference in quantum mechanics. This visualization will feature a 3D view of the slits and detection screen, a 2D plot of probability density or intensity, and interactive controls for slit separation, particle wavelength, and mode switching. We'll use **Three.js** for 3D rendering and **Plotly.js** for 2D plotting, as they are suitable for browser-based interactive graphics."
