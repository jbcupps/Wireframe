# Prompts History

1. "Please fix the ocilator page"
   - Issue: Missing oscillator.js file in static/js directory
   - Action: Created oscillator.js with visualization code using Plotly.js
   - Components: 3D plot, spiral plot, real/imaginary components with envelopes
   - Features: Interactive controls for gamma, t0, omega parameters and animation

2. "Please fix the animation on the oscillation page"
   - Issue: Animation not properly updating point positions on plots
   - Action: Rewrote updateAnimation function to correctly handle moving points
   - Changes: 
     - Added proper trace management for animation points
     - Preserved 3D camera position during updates
     - Fixed point positioning on all four plots
     - Improved animation performance with optimized updates

3. "Please create a documentation folder and add documentation detailing all of the reasons for this and the use of this application"
   - Action: Created comprehensive documentation structure
   - Files created:
     - docs/README.md: Project overview and structure
     - docs/oscillator.md: Detailed quantum oscillator documentation
     - docs/technical/architecture.md: System architecture details
     - docs/technical/visualization.md: Visualization implementation details
   - Content:
     - Theoretical background and mathematics
     - Implementation details and code examples
     - Technical architecture and deployment
     - Performance optimization and testing
     - Future considerations and maintenance

4. "Please review the linked documents for the academic papers on this and within the documentation section add some of the details and a description of the linked documents"
   - Action: Enhanced academic references section in oscillator.md
   - Added detailed descriptions for each reference:
     - Core quantum mechanics texts (Griffiths, Cohen-Tannoudji, Shankar)
     - Wave packet dynamics references (Schiff, Merzbacher)
     - Visualization methods (Feynman, Zettili)
     - Implementation references (Press, Goldstein, Thijssen, Giordano)
   - Included key equations from primary sources
   - Connected references to specific implementation details
